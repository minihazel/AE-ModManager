# AEModManager by hazel
Developed by hazelify as part of the JET / AE project. Designed to help fellow singleplayer games manage their mods easily without having to press a single key.

# Info
AEM is an AE exclusive app that allows the user to micro-manage, remove and install mods to their singleplayer easily.

**This app is a WIP, and things may break.**

# Usage

## Extracting
Unpack `AE-ModManager.zip` into your server folder (where Server.exe is)

Right click -> `7zip` -> `Extract here`

## Customizing / using
Double-click AE-ModManager.exe and make sure you can see the list of mods in your Active tab. Enable or disable any mod per your wish.

**Name, author, description and version can not be changed currently.**

# To-do list
**Wanted in future updates**:
* Edit metadata and config info via the app

# Versions
This acts both as a changelog and as a history. Only the latest version will be available for download. I do not provide support for older versions of my app.

## 1.0.0
* Initial release
